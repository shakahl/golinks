golinks is a web app that allows you to create smart bookmarks, commands and aliases by pointing your web browser's default search engine at a running instance. Similar to bunny1 or yubnub.

## Installation

### Source

```bash
$ go get github.com/prologic/golinks
```

### OS X Homebrew

There is a formula provided that you can tap and install from
[prologic/homebrew-golinks](https://github.com/prologic/homebrew-golinks):

```bash
$ brew tap prologic/golinks
$ brew install golinks
```

**NB:** This installs the latest released binary; so if you want a more
recent unreleased version from master you'll have to clone the repository
and build yourself.

### Docker

To startup a container with an image from docker hub, run the following:

```
docker run -it -d -p 8000:8000 prologic/golinks
```

Or use the following docker-compose configuration:

```
golinks:
    image: 'prologic/golinks:latest'
    container_name: golinks
    ports:
        - "8000:8000"
```

## Usage

Run golinks:

```bash
$ golinks -bind 127.0.0.1:8000 -fqdn localhost:8000
```

Set your browser's default golinks engine to http://localhost:8000/?q=%s

- [Instructions for Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-or-remove-search-engine-firefox#w_add-a-search-engine-from-the-address-bar)

Then type `help` to view the main help page, `g foo bar` to perform a [Google](https://google.com) search for "foo bar" or `list` to list all available commands.


### Custom bookmarks

To add a bookmark (or overwrite an existing one), enter `add [name] [url]` as your search query, where `name` is the shortcut for the bookmark and `url` the URL:

```
add imdb https://www.imdb.com
```

Now you can just enter `imdb` in your search bar to go straight to imdb.com.

You can also add `%s` to your URL, which will be replaced with your search query:

```
add ddg https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%s
```

Now you can use `ddg [query]` to search via DuckDuckGo, e.g. `ddg free stuff` to find yourself some free stuff.

To remove a search, use `remove [name]`, so `remove ddg` will remove the above search.

### Other commands

Use `list` to see all your bookmarks and commands (golinks comes with several useful built-ins) and `help` to view the online help page.
